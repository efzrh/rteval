The rteval program is used to evaluate the realtime performance of a
realtime Linux kernel on a particular hardware system. There is
nothing that actually requires a realtime Linux kernel, but the
latency measurements will usually be pretty bad on a stock Linux
kernel.


.SH OPTIONS
These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes ('\-\-').
.br
A summary of options is included below.
.\" For a complete description, see the Info files.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
print a help message
.TP
.B -d, \-\-duration=DURATION
Specify the length of the measurement run. DURATION is an integer with
an optional suffix indicating the units:

.br
   s - seconds
.br
   m - minutes
.br
   h - hours
.br
   d - days
.br
for example to execute a ten minute run of rteval:
.br
     $ rteval \-\-duration=10m
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Increase the verbosity of output during the test run
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Set rteval to run in quiet mode.
.TP
.B \-w WORKDIR, \-\-workdir=WORKDIR
Tell rteval to change directory to WORKDIR before creating any
subdirectories for report files. The default WORKDIR is the directory
in which rteval was started.
.TP
.B \-l LOADDIR, \-\-loaddir=LOADDIR
Tell rteval where to find the source for the loads
.TP
.B \-i INSTALLDIR, \-\-installdir=INSTALLDIR
Tell rteval where to locate installed templates.
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-sysreport
Have rteval run the sysreport utility after a run to gather
information on the running system.
.TP
.B \-D, \-\-debug
Turn on debugging prints during run
.TP
.B \-Z, \-\-summarize
Have rteval summarize an existing report. This will not cause loads or
meausurement utilities to be run.
.TP
.B \-H, \-\-raw-histogram
Generate raw histogram data for an already existing XML report
.TP
.B \-f INIFILE, \-\-inifile=INIFILE
Initialization file for configuring loads and behavior
.TP
.B \-a COMMENT, \-\-annotate=COMMENT
Add a little annotation which is stored in the report
.TP
.B \-L, \-\-logging
Log the output of the loads in the report directory
.TP
.B \-O, \-\-onlyload
Only run the loads (don't run measurement threads)
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Print rteval version and exit.
.TP
.B \-S KERNEL_VERSION, \-\-source\-download=KERNEL_VERSION
download a source kernel from kernel.org and exit

.SH GROUP OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-loads\-cpulist=CPULIST
List of CPUs where loads will run
.TP
.B \-\-measurement-cpulist=CPULIST
List of CPUs where measurement application will run
.TP
.B \-\-measurement-run-on-isolcpus
Include isolated CPUs in default cpulist


.SH CYCLICTEST OPTIONS
These are options that affect the execution behavior of the measurement and load modules.
.TP
.B \-\-cyclictest-priority=PRIORITY
SCHED_FIFO priority for measurement threads (default: 95)
.TP
.B \-\-cyclictest-interval=INTERVAL
Measurement thread interval in microseconds (default: 100)
.TP
.B \-\-cyclictest-buckets=NBUCKETS
Number of 1 microsecond histogram buckets (default: 3500)
.TP
.B \-\-cyclictest-breaktrace=USEC
Send a break trace command if latency exceeds the given number of microseconds.
.TP
.B \-\-cyclictest-threshold=USEC
Exit rteval if latency exceeds the given number of microseconds.
.TP
.B \-\-stressng-option=OPTION
Pass in command line options for the stress-ng package.
.TP
.B \-\-stressng-arg=ARG
Pass in command line arguments for the stress-ng package.
.TP
.B \-\-stressng-timeout=T
Timeout after T seconds.

.SH FILES
.BR rteval-YYYYMMDD-S
This is a directory created by rteval to hold the summary.xml file as
well as other files collected on the system. It is the current Year,
Month, and Day, followed by a sequence number for multiple runs on the
same day.

.BR summary.xml
This is an XML file that contains information about a test run and the
host system upon which rteval was run.
.BR dmesg
This is the output of the dmesg(1) program immediately following
system boot. It is copied from /var/log/dmesg.
